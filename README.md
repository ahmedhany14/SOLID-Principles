## Description

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide, examples, and best practices for implementing the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. SOLID is a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## SOLID Principles

**SOLID is an acronym that stands for:**

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


**Each principle provides guidelines to design software that is modular, easy to test, and adaptable to change. Below is a brief description of each principle:**

**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    A class should have only one reason to change

The SRP states that a class should have one, and only one, responsibility. This principle encourages the separation of concerns, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
